If you are planning to surrender a policy or just want to understand your options better, this detailed yet easy-to-understand guide on the YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator is for you.

What Is a YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator?

A YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator is a simple online tool that estimates how much money you will receive if you surrender (cancel) your life insurance policy before maturity.

When you surrender a policy early, the company does not pay the full sum assured. Instead, it pays a reduced amount called the surrender value.

In simple words:

Surrender Value = The amount you get when you close your policy before maturity.

A surrender value calculator helps you:

Get a quick estimate of surrender value

Compare surrender amount vs maturity benefits

Decide whether to surrender, continue, or take a loan on the policy

For LIC-type policies, many people use online tools. For example, you can check surrender value for LIC-type policies using this tool:

Even if your policy is from YLIC or a similar insurer, the logic and concept of surrender value remain very similar.

How Is YLIC Policy Surrender Value Decided?

The surrender value of a YLIC policy is not random. It depends on several key factors:

Type of policy

Endowment, Money Back, ULIP, Whole Life, etc.

Policy term

Total duration such as 10, 15, 20 or 25 years

Premium payment term

How many years you are supposed to pay premiums

Total premium paid so far

The total amount you have already deposited

Accrued bonuses (for traditional policies)

Reversionary bonus, loyalty additions, etc.

Surrender value factor

A percentage decided by the company based on how long the policy has run

Policy status

Active, paid-up or lapsed

Real-Life Example

Imagine Anita has a 20-year YLIC endowment policy.

Annual premium: ₹40,000

Premiums paid: 8 years

Total premium paid: ₹3,20,000

The policy has accrued some bonus over the years.

Anita now wants to stop the policy. Instead of blindly surrendering, she uses a YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator to estimate how much she will get back. She realizes that the surrender value is much lower than the maturity value and decides to continue for a few more years.

This is the power of using a calculator before taking a decision.

Basic Formula Used in YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator

Different companies may use slightly different methods, but the general idea behind the YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator is similar. A simplified formula is:

Guaranteed Surrender Value = (Total Premium Paid × Surrender Value Factor) + Accrued Bonus

Here:

Total Premium Paid = sum of all premiums you have paid so far

Surrender Value Factor = a percentage (like 30%, 40%, etc.) based on how many years have been completed

Accrued Bonus = bonus accumulated on the policy till date (for traditional plans)

Example Calculation

Let’s assume:

Annual premium: ₹50,000

Years paid: 6

Total premium paid: ₹3,00,000

Surrender value factor: 30%

Accrued bonus: ₹40,000

Now:

Guaranteed surrender part = ₹3,00,000 × 30% = ₹90,000

Add bonus: ₹90,000 + ₹40,000 = ₹1,30,000

Estimated Surrender Value ≈ ₹1,30,000

This is exactly the kind of calculation that a YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator automates for you.

Practical Use Case

Rohit urgently needs money for medical expenses. He is thinking about surrendering his YLIC policy. Before taking any final decision, he:

Opens a surrender value calculator

Inputs his policy details

Checks his surrender value

After seeing the estimated surrender value, Rohit realizes he will lose a lot of future benefits. He then checks the loan against policy option and finds that taking a loan is a better choice than surrendering.

Conditions for YLIC Policy Surrender

You usually cannot surrender a life insurance policy anytime you want and still expect a good amount. Insurance companies apply some rules and conditions.

Common conditions include:

Minimum 2–3 years of premium payment is required before any surrender value is available

For ULIP policies, there is typically a 5-year lock-in period

If the policy is lapsed, the surrender value may be very low or even zero

If you have taken a loan on the policy, the outstanding loan amount and interest will be deducted from the surrender value

So before surrendering, always check both:

Your policy document

Your YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator estimate

Real-Life Example Scenarios
Example 1: Endowment Policy

Rahul has a YLIC endowment policy:

Policy term: 20 years

Annual premium: ₹25,000

Premium paid: 10 years

Total premium paid: ₹2,50,000

Accrued bonus: ₹70,000

He uses a YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator and gets an estimated surrender value of around ₹1,45,000.

He compares this with:

Total money paid so far (₹2,50,000)

Expected maturity benefit if he continues

After comparison, he realizes surrendering now will cause a major loss, so he decides to continue the policy.

Example 2: ULIP Policy

Neha has a YLIC ULIP policy and wants to surrender after 5 years.

Current fund value: ₹1,20,000

Surrender charges: ₹5,000

Her surrender value will be:

₹1,20,000 – ₹5,000 = ₹1,15,000

The YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator for ULIPs will mainly consider:

Fund value

Surrender charges

Applicable taxes or exit load

This shows that ULIP surrender value is more market-linked, while traditional policies use a percentage formula on premiums plus bonus.

YLIC Surrender Value vs Maturity Value

It is very important to understand the difference between surrendering a policy and holding it till maturity.

Feature	Surrender Value	Maturity Value
Duration	Policy ended early	Policy completed full term
Amount	Usually lower	Usually higher
Bonus	Partial or reduced	Full eligible bonus
Life cover	Stops after surrender	Continues till maturity
Tax benefits	May reduce or reverse for some years	Generally better if conditions are met
Long-term growth	Lost	Retained

In most cases, maturity value gives much better returns compared to surrender value. That is why you should treat surrender as a last option, not the first one.

The YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator helps you see this difference clearly in numbers.

Online vs Offline Surrender Process
Online Process (if offered by the insurer)

Login to the official portal of the insurer

Go to “Policy Services” or “Surrender” section

Choose the policy you want to surrender

Fill in the surrender request form

Upload required documents (ID proof, bank details, policy document scan, etc.)

Submit the request and note down the reference number

Surrender value is processed and directly credited to your bank account

Offline Process

Visit the nearest branch office

Ask for the surrender request form

Fill it carefully with policy and bank details

Attach KYC documents and original policy bond (if required)

Submit the form at the branch counter

After verification, the company processes the surrender

Payment is sent to your registered bank account, usually within 7–15 working days

In both methods, if you use the YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator beforehand, you will have a realistic expectation of the amount you will receive.

Tax Impact of YLIC Policy Surrender

Tax treatment depends on the type of policy and how long you have held it.

When Tax May Apply

If the policy is surrendered very early (for example, before 5 years)

If you have claimed Section 80C tax benefits on the premiums

If the policy does not meet the conditions for tax-free maturity

In such cases, the surrender amount may be taxable as income. Also, past tax benefits claimed may be reversed in some situations.

When It Can Be Tax-Free

If the policy satisfies the conditions under income tax law (for example, premium is within allowed limit compared to sum assured, and policy has been held for a required minimum period)

If the policy is more investment-oriented with tax-free maturity under certain conditions

Because tax rules change and are complex, it is always wise to:

Use the YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator to know your surrender amount

Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation

Common Mistakes People Make When Surrendering a Policy

Surrendering without any calculation

People close policies emotionally, without checking the numbers on a calculator.

Ignoring the tax impact

Later they are shocked when they have to pay extra tax.

Not checking loan options

Sometimes a loan on the policy is a much better solution than surrendering.

Not comparing with maturity value

They only look at surrender money, not at future maturity benefits they are losing.

Relying only on verbal information

Trusting just an agent’s word without using a YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator or reading the policy document.

Avoiding these mistakes can save you a lot of money and regret.

Loan vs Surrender – Which Is Better?

Many policyholders are confused between taking a loan on policy and surrendering the policy.

Here’s a simple comparison:

Point	Loan on Policy	Surrender Policy
Policy status	Remains active	Ends permanently
Life cover	Continues	Stops
Amount received	Partial (as loan)	Full surrender value (reduced amount)
Interest	Payable on loan	No loan interest, but future benefits lost
Future bonuses	May continue (subject to terms)	Usually stopped
Best for	Short-term money needs	When you no longer want the policy

General rule:

If you only need money for a short time, a loan on policy is usually better.

If you are sure you no longer want the policy, then check the YLIC Policy Surrender Value Calculator and decide if surrender is acceptable.
